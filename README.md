This code works alongside Iolo Jones' manifold diffusion geometry techniques available at https://github.com/Iolo-Jones/ManifoldDiffusionGeometry.git 

This code was used to analyse the intrinsic geometry of the CelebA dataset. The report associated with this project is available in the file named CelebA_Project.pdf
